# Age Of Empires 2 DE Leaderboard Analysis

In this project we will be analysing Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition ranked 1v1 leaderboard data provided by https://aoe2.net 
We will try to find relationship between variables to determine if we can use any variables to predict current or highest rating. 
Data will be obtained using aoe.net API, so it will be a snapshot of the at a particular time. 
This is just a project for fun I decided to do out of curiosity and to sharpen my data analysis skills.
